## Hong You

## Mars
I have no clue what I'm doing. But here's the plan â€” sort of:
* From the server loop, the request string is passed into parseResponse() of the request class.
* The request content is split into whatever variables I felt were necessary at the moment.
* Validate path and set status code accordingly.
* Read and append details from respective html files.
* Response returned to the server class.
<br>

* For now I am only handling GET requests.
* I don't know how to deal with POST.
* I don't know how to deal with DELETE either.
<br>

* I decided to split the response handling to the respective methods, with each individual class. Still a WIP.
