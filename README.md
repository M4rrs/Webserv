* **Hong You:** [Main server handling.](#hong-you)
* **Me:** [Handling requests and responses.](#mars)

## JJ

## Hong You
The part I worked on deals with the main handler loop of the server. This covers the following:

<b>Initialisation</b>
* Creating the socket
* Binding the socket to the port
* Listening for incoming connections
* Accepting connections
* Closing connections

<b>Connections</b>
* Reading from the socket(s)
* Writing to the socket(s)
* Closing connections with the socket(s)

## Mars
I have no clue what I'm doing. But here's the plan â€” sort of:
* From the server loop, the request string is passed into ```parseResponse()``` of the request class.
* The request content is split into whatever variables I felt were necessary at the moment.
* Validate path and set status code accordingly.
* Read and append details from respective html files.
* Response returned to the server class.
<br>

* For now I am only handling GET requests.
* I don't know how to deal with POST.
* I don't know how to deal with DELETE either.
<br>

* I decided to split the response handling to the respective methods, with each individual class. Still a WIP.
