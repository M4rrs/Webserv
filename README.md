# WEBSERV
The aim of this project is to create a simple HTTP server.

## Current Workflow
Technically non-existent. **But,**
* **JJ:** [Configuration file parsing and CGI](#jj)
* **Hong You:** [Main server handling.](#hong-you)
* **Me:** [Handling requests and responses.](#mars)

## JJ

<b>Configuration</b>
Taking some referernce from NGINX configuration format, parse information necessary to create a minimum viable webserver. Information here will be required to run the server and send response back to browser.
* Reading from .conf file
* Scan word by word for keywords to be further process
* Keyword/format supported are as follows
```
server 			//server keyword to parse a server block
{ 				//Start of a server block
	listen 80 81 82 83; 	//listen keyword to parse first non occupied port
	root html;				//root keyword to parse the path to root folder of webserver
	index index.html;		//index keyword to parse the index page of server
	server_name trinity.com;	//server_name keyword to parse the name of website
	
	error_pages 404 html/404.html; //error_page keyword to parse error number and path to error page html
	error_pages 405 html/405.html;

	location /cgi-bin { //location keyword to parse URI of website
		allowedMethods   GET POST; //allowedMethods keyword to parse the permitted method of a request
		index select_cgi.html; //index keyword to parse the index page of location URI, root + URI + index
	}
	
	location /directory {
		allowedMethods   GET;
		autoindex on;
	}
}		//End of a server block
//Any keyword not supported will result in exception being thrown
```

<b>CGI Execution</b>
A simple CGI execution function is also written to run scripts/executable in child process and response will be return.

* Environtment variable(Env) of webserver and argument(Arg) will be created
* Env and Arg will be passed to execeve() to run scripts or executable


## Hong You
The part I worked on deals with the main handler loop of the server. This covers the following:

<b>Initialisation</b>
* Creating the socket
* Binding the socket to the port
* Listening for incoming connections
* Accepting connections
* Closing connections

<b>Connections</b>
* Reading from the socket(s)
* Writing to the socket(s)
* Closing connections with the socket(s)

## Mars
I have no clue what I'm doing. But here's the plan â€” sort of:
* From the server loop, the request string is passed into ```parseResponse()``` of the request class.
* The request content is split into whatever variables I felt were necessary at the moment.
* Validate path and set status code accordingly.
* Read and append details from respective html files.
* Response returned to the server class.
<br>

* For now I am only handling GET requests.
* I don't know how to deal with POST.
* I don't know how to deal with DELETE either.
<br>

* I decided to split the response handling to the respective methods, with each individual class. Still a WIP.
	* Created a base class for responses. For obvious reasons.
